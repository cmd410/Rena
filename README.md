# Rena

Rena is a [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org) inspired plugin for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) that brings renpy-like language for you to help write narrative for your games in a more streamlined fashion. No more convoluted csv tables or json editing, just write story and control flow with menus, conditional statements and emit signals when something significant happens in the story. Rena is designed to be well integrated into engine to provide maximum flexibility. 

> Rena is still in early stage of development, might be unstable, **Not recommended for production** yet. If you expiriencing problems, report them in the issues tab, I'll try to fix everything as fast as I can. You can also request features, of course.
